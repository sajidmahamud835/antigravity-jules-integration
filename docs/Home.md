# Welcome to the Antigravity Jules Integration Wiki

This project connects **Google's Jules API** directly to **VS Code** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling a seamless, AI-powered coding experience.

> [!NOTE]
> **Compatibility Notice**: This extension currently **requires [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev)** to function. A standalone VS Code version will be released soon.

*   **🧠 Context Awareness**: Automatically gathers file context and git diffs for Jules.
*   **🔄 Two-Way Sync**: Apply AI suggestions directly to your local codebase.
